MALLOC

Allowed Functions:
	1. void* mmap(void * addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset)
		-creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the
       calling process.  The starting address for the new mapping is
       specified in addr.  The length argument specifies the length of the
       mapping (which must be greater than 0).
	2. int munmap(void * addr, size_t length, int prot)
		-is a system call deletes the mappings for the specified address range, and causes further references to addresses within the range to generate invalid memory references.
	3. int getpagesize(void)
		-returns the number of bytes in a memory page, where "page" is a fixed-length block, the unit for memory allocation and file mapping performed by mmap(2).
	4. int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlim)
		-system calls get resource limits. Each resource has an associated soft and hard limit, as defined by the rlimit structure:
	-struct rlimit {
               rlim_t rlim_cur;  /* Soft limit */
               rlim_t rlim_max;  /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */
         };

Malloc functionality(100 allocations each zone):
	1. TINY: from 1 to n bytes
		- will be stored in N bytes big zones.
	1. SMALL: from n to m bytes
		- will be stored in M bytes big zones.
	1. LARGE: > than m
		- will be stored out of zone, with mmap().

Bounus:
	-Malloc debug envitoment varables
	-Create a show_alloc_men_ex()
	-Defragment thefreed memory
	-Manage the use of your mallocin a multi-threaded progrma(pthread lib)
